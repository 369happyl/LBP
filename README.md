LBP LA BELA PIZZA, or "The Good Pizza" in English, is a really good pizza website. I started this project when I was 13 years old, and I'm developing it a lot. I know HTML, CSS, and JS. If I'm not mistaken, there are even Sololearn certificates on the website, which is really cool. My dream is to be a full-stack programmer. I am trilingual in Portuguese, English, and French. I was born in Brazil, and I've spent a few sleepless nights studying JS and Python, lol. I'm starting with Vue and React at 13. I think that by the time I'm 18, I'll already know it, right? This LBP has a JSON of ~3000 lines. I even lost a comma in the middle, ​Debugging Stories: I've spent several sleepless nights mastering Python and JS logic. I even survived the "missing comma" crisis in a 3k-line file! and that's it for now.
